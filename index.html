  Tailwind CSS Refactor Assignment
  Name: Hojin Choi

  REFLECTION:

  1. What was the biggest challenge switching to Tailwind?
     Honestly the hardest part was finding the right class names. Like I knew I wanted
     padding but I had to look up whether it was p-4 or pad-4 (it's p-4 lol). The docs
     helped a lot but it still took time to get used to.

  2. What are the advantages of utility-first CSS?
     I don't have to keep switching between my HTML and CSS files anymore which is
     actually really nice. Everything is in one place. Also I stopped worrying about
     naming classes like "wrapper" or "container2" which was always annoying.

  3. What are the disadvantages?
     The HTML looks really messy now. Like my nav has like 10 classes on one line and
     it's kind of hard to read. Also I can't just copy my style.css to reuse on
     another project. I'd have to redo all the classes.

  4. Would you use Tailwind on future projects?
     Probably it depends on the project. If it's something small and simple I might 
     just write regular CSS. But if it's a bigger project with a lot of components 
     I think Tailwind could save time and make it easier to maintain.
